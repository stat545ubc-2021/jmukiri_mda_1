This was a series of 3 analysis which constituted of:

- [x] Mini data analysis 1: writing and exploring a data set.
  * Choose favorite data set 
  * Explore chosen data set`
  * Write research questions
  * Created `README.md`
  * Created a release for this milestone 
  
- [x] Mini data analysis 2: Summarzing and cleaning a vancouver data set
  * Process and summarize your data 
  * Tidy your data
  * updated `README.md`
  
- [x] Mini data analysis 3
  * Special Data Types 
  * Modelling
  * Reading and Writing data
  * updated `README.md`
